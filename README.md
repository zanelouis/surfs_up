Project Overview

W. Avy setup a meeting with her Directors to show how we can execute a query and run a Flask App to demonstrate our weather data online using Python code.

1. Calculate our start and end date
2. Identify our columms and measurements
3. Query and filter data from our databases
4. Create dataframes and lists from our queries
5. Create plots and statistal analysis from our dataframes

Resources

    Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
    Software: Python 3.6.1 Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1
    Application: Flask, SQLAlchemy

Summary

The analysis of the weather data show that:

 - There were 9 stations
 - USC00519281 was the most active station with a count of 2772
 - Of the previous year the temperatures were mostly above 67 degrees
 - The max precipitation was 6.7
 - The average precipitations was 0.177279

Challenge Overview

The Directors have requested some additional data to complete in which we will assist with in this challenge.

1. Calculate the temperature measurements for the month of June
2. Calculate the temperature measurements for the month of December
